# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
## Introduction
This Software Requirements Analysis (SRA) document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of an AirBnB Online Booking System. The system is intended to allow users to search, view, and reserve services through a web-based interface. It aims to streamline the booking process, enhance user experience, and improve service provider efficiency. The document serves as a foundation for system design, development, and validation, ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system’s scope and capabilities.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
This is a phase in software development lifecycle (SDLC) where project team gathers, analyzes and defines the requirements of a software product being developed ensuring all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the SDLC that lays the foundation for a successful software project. It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what needs to be built.

- **Clarity and Understanding**  
  Helps all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project's goals and expectations.

- **Scope Definition**  
  Clearly outlines the boundaries of the project to avoid scope creep and misalignment.

- **Basis of Design and Development**  
  Provides the foundation for system architecture, UI/UX design, and coding efforts.

- **Cost and Time Estimation**  
  Enables accurate forecasting of resources, budget, and project timelines.

- **Quality Assurance**  
  Defines measurable requirements that guide testing and validation to ensure product quality.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement analysis involves several structured activities to ensure a clear understanding and documentation of what the software must accomplish.

### 1. **Requirement Gathering**

- **Interviews**: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.  
- **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a broader audience.  
- **Workshops**: Organizing collaborative sessions with stakeholders to discuss and capture requirements.  
- **Observation**: Observing end-users in their work environment to understand real needs and workflows.  
- **Document Analysis**: Reviewing existing documents and systems to understand current functionalities.

### 2. **Requirement Elicitation**

- **Brainstorming**: Generating ideas and uncovering needs in open group discussions.  
- **Focus Groups**: Engaging selected stakeholders in focused discussions to gain detailed insights.  
- **Prototyping**: Developing early system models or UI mockups to help stakeholders visualize features.

### 3. **Requirement Documentation**

- **Requirement Specification Document**: A comprehensive document listing all functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **User Stories**: Descriptions of features from the user’s point of view to ensure user-centric design.  
- **Use Cases**: Diagrams and narratives illustrating interactions between users and the system.

### 4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**

- **Requirement Prioritization**: Ranking requirements by importance and business value.  
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Evaluating technical, financial, and schedule-related constraints.  
- **Modeling**: Using visual tools (e.g., data flow diagrams, ER diagrams) to represent system behavior and data.

### 5. **Requirement Validation**

- **Review and Approval**: Ensuring that requirements are correct, complete, and agreed upon by stakeholders.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Defining specific conditions that a requirement must meet to be accepted.  
- **Traceability**: Linking each requirement to corresponding design, development, and testing components to ensure full coverage.

## Types of Requirements
1. **Functional Requirements**
**Definition:** Describe what the system should do.
**Examples:** User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

**Key Functional Requirements:**

- **Search Properties:** Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
- **User Registration:** New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
- **Property Listings:** Display properties with essential details and images.
- **Booking System:** Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration process for users.
2. **Non-functional Requirements**
**Definition:** Describe how the system should perform.
**Examples:** Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

**Key Non-functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
- **Security:** Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
- **Usability:** The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
- **Reliability:** The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.
   
## Use Case Diagrams
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
**Benefits of use case diagrams**
- Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
- Provide a basis for testing and validation.
- Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
