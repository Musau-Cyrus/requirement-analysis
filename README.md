# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
##Introduction
This Software Requirements Analysis (SRA) document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of an AirBnB Online Booking System. The system is intended to allow users to search, view, and reserve services through a web-based interface. It aims to streamline the booking process, enhance user experience, and improve service provider efficiency. The document serves as a foundation for system design, development, and validation, ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the systemâ€™s scope and capabilities.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
This is a phase in software development lifecycle (SDLC) where project team gathers, analyzes and defines the requirements of a software product being developed ensuring all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the SDLC that lays the foundation for a successful software project. It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what needs to be built.

- **Clarity and Understanding**  
  Helps all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project's goals and expectations.

- **Scope Definition**  
  Clearly outlines the boundaries of the project to avoid scope creep and misalignment.

- **Basis of Design and Development**  
  Provides the foundation for system architecture, UI/UX design, and coding efforts.

- **Cost and Time Estimation**  
  Enables accurate forecasting of resources, budget, and project timelines.

- **Quality Assurance**  
  Defines measurable requirements that guide testing and validation to ensure product quality.
